The options are DNPH, Lucas reagent, Tollen's reagent, and Fehling's solution.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each reagent does. DNPH (2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine) is typically used to test for carbonyl groups, like ketones and aldehydes. It forms a precipitate with those, so maybe not for alcohols directly. \n\nLucas reagent is something I remember is related to alcohols. I think it's used to differentiate between primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. The reaction involves HCl and zinc chloride. Tertiary alcohols react fastest, forming a cloudy solution quickly, secondary take a bit longer, and primary might not react much at room temperature. So Lucas reagent helps in distinguishing the classes of alcohols based on their reaction rates. That seems relevant here since the question is about identifying 10°, 20°, 30° alcohols. \n\nTollen's reagent is for aldehydes. It's the silver mirror test. Fehling's solution is also for aldehydes, specifically aliphatic ones, and turns from blue to red precipitate. Neither of these are for alcohols. \n\nSo putting it all together, the correct answer should be B, Lucas reagent.\n</think>",
        "ans": "The correct answer is **B: Lucas reagent**. \n\nLucas reagent (HCl with ZnCl₂) is used to distinguish between primary (10°), secondary (20°), and tertiary (30°) alcohols based on their reaction rates. Tertiary alcohols react immediately, secondary alcohols react within a few minutes, while primary alcohols do not react significantly at room temperature. Other reagents like DNPH, Tollen's, or Fehling's are used for different functional groups (carbonyl compounds or aldehydes), not alcohols. \n\n**Answer:** B"

Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like a + 1/a, squaring both sides might help. Let me try that. So, if I square the left side, (a + 1/a)², that should equal 4², which is 16. Expanding the left side, (a + 1/a)² equals a² + 2*(a)*(1/a) + (1/a)². Simplifying the middle term, 2*(a)*(1/a) is 2*1, which is 2. So the equation becomes a² + 2 + 1/a² = 16. \n\nNow, if I subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the terms I need, that would give me a² + 1/a² = 16 - 2. So 16 minus 2 is 14. Therefore, the value of a² + 1/a² should be 14. Looking at the options, option A is 14. So the correct answer must be A. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the algebra? Squaring (a + 1/a) gives a² + 2 + 1/a², right? Yes, because (a + b)² is a² + 2ab + b². Here, b is 1/a, so the cross term is 2*a*(1/a) = 2. So yes, subtracting 2 gives 14. That seems correct. So the answer is A.\n</think>",
        "ans": "The correct answer is **A: 14**. \n\n**Explanation:**  \nGiven, \\( a + \\frac{1}{a} = 4 \\).  \nSquaring both sides:  \n\\[\n\\left( a + \\frac{1}{a} \\right)^2 = 4^2 \\implies a^2 + 2 \\cdot a \\cdot \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{a^2} = 16.  \n\\]  \nSimplifying the middle term:  \n\\[\na^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{a^2} = 16 \\implies a^2 + \\frac{1}{a^2} = 16 - 2 = 14.  \n\\]  \nThus, the value of \\( a^2 + \\frac{1}{a^2} \\) is **14** (Option A)."

The chain rule states that the derivative of e^u is e^u multiplied by the derivative of u with respect to x. Here, u would be (ax - b). \n\nSo, let's apply that. The derivative of e^(ax - b) should be e^(ax - b) times the derivative of (ax - b) with respect to x. Now, the derivative of ax with respect to x is just a, since a is a constant. The derivative of -b with respect to x is 0 because b is also a constant. So, putting that together, the derivative is e^(ax - b) multiplied by a.

The mesoderm is one of the three primary germ layers in the early embryo, along with the ectoderm and endoderm. Each germ layer gives rise to specific tissues and organs. The mesoderm typically forms structures like muscles, bones, connective tissues, the circulatory system, and some organs.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. জিহ্বার আবরণ (Tongue coating) – The tongue's epithelium might come from the ectoderm or endoderm.

Hmm, I remember that for a quadratic function, the vertex form can help find the minimum or maximum. Since the coefficient of x² is positive (1 in this case), the parabola opens upwards, so it does have a minimum point.\n\nWait, but how do I find the value of 'a' here? The vertex of a quadratic equation in the form f(x) = ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Wait, but here the function is f(x) = x² + a x. So in standard form, the coefficient of x² is 1, and the coefficient of x is 'a'. So the vertex (which is the minimum here) should be at x = -a/(2*1) = -a/2. \n\nThe problem states that this minimum occurs at x = 2. So setting -a/2 = 2. Solving for 'a', multiply both sides by 2: -a = 4 => a = -4. Wait, but none of the options have -4. The options are 16, 8, -16, and D which is labeled as Choice 4 but the content isn't clear. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. The function is f(x) = x² + a x. The derivative approach might be better. Taking the derivative f'(x) = 2x + a. At the minimum point, the derivative is zero. So setting 2x + a = 0. Given that the minimum is at x=2, substitute x=2 into this equation: 2*2 + a = 0 => 4 + a = 0 => a = -4. Again, getting a = -4. But none of the options A, B, C, D (as listed) have -4. The options given are A:16, B:8, C:-16, D:Choice4. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options? Or perhaps I misunderstood the function.\n\nWait, the original function is written as f(x) = x2 + ax. Wait, maybe the formatting is off. Is it x squared plus a times x, so f(x) = x² + a x? That's what I assumed. If that's the case, then my calculation leads to a = -4. But the options don't include that. Let me check the options again. The user provided options as {'A': '16', 'B': '8', 'C': '-16', 'D': 'Choice 4'}. So options A, B, C, D. C is -16. Hmm. Wait, maybe the original function was written differently. Wait, maybe there's a typo. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: যদি f(x)=x2+axf(x)=x2+ax এর x=2 বিন্দুতে একটি সর্বনিম্ন মান থাকে তবে a এর মান কত? Wait, the way the function is written might be f(x) = x² + a x, but maybe there's a mistake in the way it's presented. Alternatively, perhaps the function is f(x) = x² + a x²? Wait, but that would be f(x) = x²(1 + a), which is a quadratic function with coefficient (1+a). But the user wrote it as f(x)=x2+axf(x)=x2+ax. Maybe that's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the function is f(x) = x² + a x, as I originally thought.\n\nIf my calculation gives a = -4, but the options don't have that, then perhaps there's a mistake in the options, or I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the function is different. Wait, another possibility: maybe the function is f(x) = x² + a x^2? But that would be f(x) = x²(1 + a), which would have a minimum at x=0 if 1+a >0, but the problem states the minimum is at x=2. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the function is f(x) = x^2 + a/x? But that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's f(x) = x² + a x^3? But then it's a cubic function, which doesn't have a minimum unless considering local minima. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written with a formatting error. Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote: যদি f(x)=x2+axf(x)=x2+ax এর x=2 বিন্দুতে একটি সর্বনিম্ন মান থাকে তবে a এর মান কত? It looks like there's a repetition of the function: \"x2+axf(x)=x2+ax\". Wait, that might be a mistake. Maybe the correct function is f(x) = x² + a x. Otherwise, if it's written as x² + a x f(x) = x² + a x, that would mean f(x) is defined recursively? But that doesn't make sense. Perhaps it's a typo, and the intended function is f(x) = x² + a x.\n\nAssuming that's the case, then the correct answer would be a = -4. But since that's not in the options, I must have made a mistake. Wait, maybe the problem is written differently. Wait, in Bangla, sometimes exponents are written with ^ symbol. But here it's written as x2, which is x squared. So, function f(x) = x² + a x.\n\nWait, let me re-derive using calculus. The first derivative f'(x) = 2x + a. Setting to zero at x=2: 2*2 + a = 0 → 4 + a =0 → a= -4. So the answer should be a= -4. But none of the options are -4. The options are 16, 8, -16, and D (which is labeled as Choice 4, perhaps a typo). Maybe the options are incorrect, or I misunderstood the function.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options. Alternatively, maybe the function is f(x) = x² + a x^4? Let's see. Then the derivative would be 2x + 4a x³. Setting x=2: 2*2 +4a*(2)^3 =4 + 32a =0 → 32a= -4 → a= -4/32= -1/8. That also doesn't match the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is f(x) = x² + a/x? Then derivative is 2x -a/x². Setting x=2: 2*2 - a/(2²)= 4 -a/4 =0 → a/4=4 → a=16. So a=16, which is option A. Wait, this gives a=16. But why would the function be written as x² + a/x? Because the original problem says f(x)=x2+ax. If there's a missing slash, like f(x)=x² + a/x, then that would change everything. But the original problem in Bangla is written as \"x2+axf(x)=x2+ax\". It's possible that in the problem statement, the function was intended to be f(x) = x² + a/x, but due to a typo, it's written as x2+ax. Alternatively, maybe the function is x² + a x, but the options are wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in Bangla, and the function was supposed to be f(x) = x^2 + a x, but the options are incorrect. But if the correct answer is -4 and none of the options match, then there's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me check again.\n\nFunction f(x) = x² + a x. The derivative is 2x + a. Setting derivative to zero at x=2: 2*2 +a =0 → a= -4. So yes, a= -4. But the options given are A:16, B:8, C:-16, D:Choice4. So none of these. But perhaps the original problem had a different function. Wait, perhaps the function is f(x) = x² + a x^3. Then derivative is 2x + 3a x². Setting x=2: 2*2 +3a*(4)=4 +12a=0 →12a= -4 →a= -4/12= -1/3. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is f(x)=x^2 + a, which is just a parabola shifted vertically. Then the minimum is always at x=0, so a is irrelevant. But the question says the minimum is at x=2, which wouldn't make sense here. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is f(x) = (x + a)^2. Expanding that is x² + 2a x + a². Then the minimum is at x = -a. So setting -a =2 →a= -2. Again, not in options.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo in the options. For example, if option C was -8 instead of -16, but here it's -16. Alternatively, maybe the function is f(x) = x² + a x, and the problem is asking for the value of 'a' such that the minimum occurs at x=2. But the answer is -4, which is not listed. Therefore, the given options might be incorrect. But since the user provided the options as A:16, B:8, C:-16, D:Choice4, and the correct answer isn't there, maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: using completing the square. For f(x) = x² + a x. Completing the square: x² + a x = (x + a/2)^2 - (a²)/4. So the vertex is at x = -a/2. Setting this to 2 gives -a/2 =2 → a= -4. Same result. So unless the function is different, the answer should be a= -4. But since that's not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or options. However, since the options include C: -16, maybe I miscalculated. Let's check if a=-16, then the vertex would be at x = -(-16)/2 =8. Which is x=8. But the question wants it at x=2. So that's not matching. If a= -16, then the vertex is at x=8, which doesn't match. If a=8, then vertex at x= -8/2=-4. Also not 2. If a=16, then vertex at x= -16/2= -8. So none of the options C: -16 would lead to vertex at x=8, which is not 2. So none of the options given are correct. But the problem asks to choose from the given options. So perhaps there's a mistake. But since the user provided options, maybe the correct answer is not listed, but perhaps the intended answer was C: -16 due to a miscalculation. Let me see: if someone mistakenly took the second derivative, but that's not necessary here. Alternatively, maybe the problem was to find the minimum value, not the value of a. Wait, no, the question clearly asks for a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is f(x) =x^2 + a x^4. Then the derivative is 2x +4a x^3. Setting to zero at x=2: 2*2 +4a*(8)=4 +32a=0 →32a= -4→a= -4/32= -1/8. Not matching options. Alternatively, if the function was f(x)=x^3 + a x, then derivative is 3x² +a. Setting to zero at x=2: 3*(4) +a=12 +a=0→a= -12. Still not in options.\n\nHmm. This is perplexing. Given the options, none seem to match the correct answer of a= -4. But since the user is asking to choose from the given options, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I need to recheck everything. Wait, perhaps the function is f(x)=x² + a/x. Then derivative is 2x - a/x². Setting to zero at x=2: 2*2 - a/(4) =4 -a/4=0 →a/4=4→a=16. That would be option A:16. But then the function is f(x)=x² +16/x. Is that possible? If the original problem's function was f(x)=x² +a/x, then a=16 is correct. But the user wrote the function as f(x)=x2+axf(x)=x2+ax, which seems like a repetition. But maybe in the actual problem, the function is f(x)=x² +a/x, but due to a typo, it's written as x2+ax. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in writing the function. For example, in Bangla, sometimes the multiplication is denoted differently. If the function is f(x)=x² + a/x, then the answer would be 16. But based on the given problem statement as written, it's x² + a x.\n\nGiven that, the correct answer is a= -4, which is not among the options. However, if we assume that there was a typo and the function is f(x)=x² +a/x, then a=16 (option A). But that's a big assumption. Alternatively, the options may have been mistyped. Since the user included option C as -16, which is four times the correct answer, perhaps there was a mistake in calculation where someone multiplied by 4 instead of dividing. For example, if someone thought that the vertex is at x= a/2 instead of -a/2, then setting a/2=2 gives a=4, which is not the case. But again, not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the minimum value at x=2, not the value of a. But the question clearly asks for a. Given that, perhaps the answer is not listed, but among the options given, none are correct. However, since the user expects an answer from the given options, I must choose the closest or consider a possible mistake. But according to the problem as written, the correct answer isn't present. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps there was a mistake in the options. In that case, maybe option C: -16 is intended, but that would be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the function is different. \n\nWait, another possibility: If the function is f(x) =x² + a x^2, then f(x) =x²(1 +a). The derivative is 2x(1 +a). Setting to zero: 2x(1+a)=0. The critical point is at x=0. So regardless of a (unless 1+a=0), the minimum is at x=0, not 2. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is f(x) =x^2 + a e^x. Then derivative is 2x +a e^x. Setting x=2: 4 +a e²=0 → a= -4/e², which is not in the options. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck here. According to the given function and the correct method, the answer is a= -4, which isn't listed. But since I have to choose from the given options, maybe there's a mistake in the problem. However, considering possible variations, if the function was f(x)=x^4 +a x^2, then derivative is 4x³ +2a x. Setting x=2: 4*(8) +2a*2=32 +4a=0→4a= -32→a= -8. Which is option B:8. But no, a= -8. But option B is 8. So not matching. Alternatively, if the function is f(x)=x^3 +a x, then derivative 3x² +a. At x=2: 3*4 +a=12 +a=0→a= -12. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, considering the function f(x)=x² +a x, perhaps the problem is asking for the y-coordinate of the minimum, which would be f(2)=4 +2a. But the question asks for 'a', not the minimum value. So that's not relevant.\n\nGiven that none of the options seem correct, but the user might have intended a different function. Alternatively, maybe the original problem was in a different form. For example, if the function was f(x) =x² -16x, then the vertex would be at x=16/2=8. Which is not 2. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is written as f(x)=x² + a x and the minimum value is 2, but the question states the minimum is at x=2. Still, the calculation leads to a= -4.\n\nSince the problem's options don't include -4, but the user must have intended one of the given options, perhaps there was a mistake in the problem. However, as an assistant, I have to proceed. Given that, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the function is f(x)=x² +a x², but that leads to a different result. Alternatively, perhaps the question meant to ask for the value of the minimum at x=2, but that's not what the question says.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem involves a different condition. For example, if the function has a minimum value of 2 at x=2, then f(2)=4 +2a=minimum value. But the question states that the minimum occurs at x=2, not the value of the minimum. So the value of 'a' affects where the minimum occurs, not the minimum value itself.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the correct answer is a= -4. Since this is not among the options, I can only conclude that there's an error in the options provided. However, since I must choose from the given options, and the closest would be none, but in the context of the user's question, perhaps the intended answer is C: -16, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, if the problem had a different function, but based on the given function, the answer isn't present. But since the user might expect me to proceed, I need to choose the best possible answer, even if there's an error. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a miscalculation step where someone squared 2 in the derivative. For example, if someone thought that the derivative of x² +a x is 2x + a x, which is incorrect. Then setting 2*2 +a*2=0 →4 +2a=0 →a= -2. Still not in options. Alternatively, if someone confused the vertex formula as x= b/(2a) instead of -b/(2a). For the function f(x)=x² +a x, which is 1x² +a x +0. Then vertex at x= -a/(2*1)= -a/2. If someone instead did x= a/(2*1)= a/2, then setting a/2=2 →a=4. Not in options. Alternatively, if the problem was to find the maximum instead of the minimum, but since the coefficient of x² is positive, it's a minimum. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem was written in a different way. For example, f(x)=x² +a x, and the minimum value is at x=2. But the options given are for a different problem. However, without further information, I must conclude that there's an error in the options. But since the user expects an answer, perhaps they made a typo in the options. If the correct answer is a= -4, but it's not present, but option C is -16, which is four times the correct value. Maybe during calculation, someone multiplied by 4 instead of dividing. For example, vertex at x= -a/2=2 →a= -4. If someone thought x= -a/4=2, then a= -8, which is option B. But that's still not matching. Alternatively, maybe someone used a different formula, like x= -b/(4a), which is for something else. But I don't know.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option C: -16, but that's incorrect based on the correct method. Alternatively, the problem has a mistake. But in the absence of more information, and since I need to choose from the given options, perhaps the user intended to write a different function. Alternatively, the options are incorrect. However, as per the problem stated, the correct answer is not available. But since this is a multiple-choice question and I must choose the best possible answer from the options, I might have to indicate that there's a mistake. However, the user requires an answer in Bangla, so perhaps I should proceed by stating the correct method and mention that none of the options are correct, but if forced to choose, maybe there's a typo. But the user might have provided the options correctly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function in the problem is f(x)=x² +a x^3, but that's a different function. For f(x)=x² +a x^3, derivative is 2x +3a x². Setting x=2: 4 +12a=0 →12a= -4→a= -4/12= -1/3. Not in options. \n\nGiven all this confusion, but based on the original function f(x)=x² +a x, the correct answer is a= -4, which is not among the options. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the options. But since the user provided options A:16, B:8, C:-16, D:Choice4, and in the absence of further information, I might conclude that there's a typo in the options and perhaps option C was meant to be -4. But since it's -16, that's not the case. Alternatively, the function was mistyped. If the function was f(x)=x^4 +a x^2, then derivative is 4x^3 +2a x. Setting x=2: 32 +4a=0 →a= -8 (option B), but that's a different function. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, the correct answer is a= -4, which is not listed. However, considering possible errors, if the function was f(x)=x^2 + a/x, then a=16 (option A). But this is speculative. Given the options, none are correct, but if the user insists on selecting from the given options, there's a mistake. But since the user is likely expecting the answer based on standard calculus, I have to state that none of the options are correct, but since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps option C: -16 is intended due to a miscalculation. But in reality, the correct answer is not present. \n\nBut since the user requires an answer in Bangla, and the options are given, I must proceed. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is C: -16, assuming that the vertex formula was mistakenly applied. For example, if someone thought the vertex is at x= a/2 instead of -a/2, and set a/2=2 →a=4, but that's not the case. Alternatively, if someone thought the formula is x= -b/a instead of -b/(2a), then x= -a/1=2 →a= -2. Still not in options. \n\nAlternatively, if the function is f(x)=x^2 + a x, and the minimum occurs at x=2, but the options have a mistake where a is replaced by 4a. For example, if the correct answer is -4, but option C is -16 (which is 4 times -4), perhaps due to a miscalculation step. If someone squared x=2 and multiplied by something, but I can't see how. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem involves integrating or another operation. But the question is about finding a so that the minimum is at x=2. So calculus approach is correct. \n\nGiven all this, the most plausible conclusion is that there's a mistake in the options. However, since I must provide an answer from the given choices, and considering that none are correct, but if I have to choose, perhaps option C: -16 is the closest, but it's incorrect. Alternatively, the user might have made a typo and the correct options should include -4. Without that, I can't proceed. \n\nBut wait, the user wrote the options as {'A': '16', 'B': '8', 'C': '-16', 'D': 'Choice 4'}. The last option D is labeled as 'Choice 4' which might be a placeholder or a mistake. If the actual option D was -4, then that would be correct. But the user wrote D as 'Choice 4', which is not a valid option. Assuming that's a typo and the correct option is D: -4, but the user hasn't provided it. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information, there's no correct answer among the options provided. However, if forced to choose the closest possible, but acknowledging the mistake, I would say the correct answer is not listed. But since the user expects an answer, I'll have to go with the calculation and note the discrepancy. But in the context of the problem, perhaps the intended answer is option C: -16, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. \n\nWait, another way: If the function's minimum value is at x=2, then we can also set the function's value at x=2 to be less than the values around it. For example, f(2) < f(2+h) and f(2) < f(2-h) for small h. But that's another way to confirm, but that leads to the same condition as the derivative. So again, a= -4. \n\nGiven that, I think there's a mistake in the options. But since I must select from the given options, and the correct answer isn't there, I'll have to state that. However, the user provided the options, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. But in the context of the original question, I think the correct answer is not listed. But the user might expect me to choose option C: -16. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in Bangla and the function is written with a different exponent. For example, if the function is f(x)=x² + a x^4, but that's not the case here. \n\nConsidering all possibilities, I think the answer is not present, but the closest is option C: -16, though it's incorrect. However, given the options, I think the intended answer might be C: -16, but I can't justify it. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, perhaps there's a mistake. \n\nBut since the user requires an answer in Bangla, I'll proceed to explain that the correct answer is not among the options, but based on the calculation, it's -4. However, since that's not an option, there's an error. But the user might want the correct option based on the given choices. In that case, perhaps option C: -16 is intended, but that's incorrect. \n\nBut given the problem as stated, the answer should be:\n\nThe correct answer is not listed, but based on the calculation, a = -4. However, since this is not an option, there's likely a mistake in the question or options. Among the given options, none are correct.\n\nBut in the context of the original question, perhaps the intended answer is C: -16, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, the user might have made a mistake in the options. \n\nSince the user might have intended a different function, such as f(x)=x² + a/x, leading to a=16 (option A), but that's speculative. \n\nConsidering all this, I'll proceed to state the correct answer based on the given function and note the discrepancy.\n</think>",

        "reasoning": "<think>Okay, let's see. The problem is about a boat in a current. The current's speed is 10 m/s and the boat's speed in still water is 20 m/s. The question is asking at what angle should the boat start moving to reach the exact opposite point of departure. \n\nHmm, I remember from physics that when a boat wants to go directly across a river, it has to compensate for the current. But here, the destination is exactly opposite, so the boat needs to counteract the river's flow. \n\nWait, the boat's speed relative to the water is 20 m/s, and the river's speed is 10 m/s. To reach the opposite point, the resultant velocity of the boat should be directly across the river. That means the boat's velocity relative to the water plus the river's velocity should result in a straight path across. \n\nSo, the boat has to aim upstream at an angle so that the river's current cancels out the downstream drift. Let me think about vector components here. The boat's velocity has two components: one perpendicular to the current (to cross the river) and one upstream against the current. The river's current is downstream at 10 m/s. \n\nThe boat's upstream component needs to balance the river's downstream speed. So if the boat's speed is 20 m/s, the component of its velocity upstream should be equal to 10 m/s to counteract the river. \n\nUsing trigonometry, the upstream component is 20*sin(theta), right? Because if theta is the angle upstream from the direct perpendicular direction. Wait, maybe theta is measured from the opposite bank? Or is it from the direction perpendicular?\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's assume the boat is moving at an angle θ upstream relative to the perpendicular direction. Then, the component of the boat's velocity that's upstream is 20*sinθ. This component needs to equal the river's speed of 10 m/s to cancel it out. So 20*sinθ = 10 → sinθ = 10/20 = 0.5. So θ = 30 degrees. \n\nBut wait, θ is measured from the perpendicular direction. So the angle relative to the direction straight across is 30 degrees upstream. So the total angle from the starting point's opposite direction would be 90 degrees plus 30? No, wait. Wait, maybe I need to visualize this.\n\nIf the boat is heading upstream at 30 degrees relative to the perpendicular line (the line directly across the river), then the direction it's pointing is 30 degrees upstream from the perpendicular. So the angle with respect to the direction of the current (which is along the river flow) would be 180 - 30 = 150 degrees? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle is measured from the direction opposite to the current. If the boat needs to go directly across, the resultant path should be perpendicular. The boat's velocity relative to water (20 m/s) has two components: one perpendicular (to cross) and one upstream (to cancel the current). \n\nThe river flows at 10 m/s downstream. The boat's upstream component must be 10 m/s to counteract. So 20*sinθ = 10 → sinθ = 0.5 → θ=30°. That angle is measured from the perpendicular direction towards upstream. So the direction the boat is pointing is 30 degrees upstream from the perpendicular. \n\nBut when the question says \"কত কোণে রওনা দিতে হবে\", meaning at what angle should it start, probably measured from the line that is directly opposite to the destination. Wait, the problem states \"যাত্রা বিন্দুর ঠিক বিপরীতে পৌঁছাতে\", which means to reach the exact opposite point of the starting point. So the direction of the boat's velocity relative to the ground should be straight across, but due to the current, the boat has to aim upstream. \n\nThe angle θ here is the angle between the boat's direction (relative to the water) and the line perpendicular to the current. So if the boat is moving at 30 degrees upstream relative to the perpendicular, then the angle from the starting point's perspective would be 30 degrees. Wait, but the options include 150°, which is 180° - 30°, maybe. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's model it with vectors. The boat's velocity relative to water is 20 m/s at an angle θ upstream from the perpendicular. The current is 10 m/s downstream (along the river). The resultant velocity relative to the ground should have no downstream component. \n\nSo, the boat's velocity relative to ground has two components: \n\n- Perpendicular (across the river): 20*cosθ \n\n- Along the river: 20*sinθ - 10 (since the boat's component upstream is 20*sinθ, and the current is downstream 10, so net is 20*sinθ - 10). \n\nFor the boat to reach directly opposite, the along-river component must be zero. So 20*sinθ -10 =0 → sinθ=10/20=0.5 → θ=30°. \n\nSo the angle θ is 30 degrees upstream from the perpendicular direction. But how is this angle measured in the context of the question? The options are 120°, 150°, etc. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the angle with respect to the direction of the current (i.e., the river's flow). If the boat is pointing 30 degrees upstream from the perpendicular, then the angle with respect to the downstream direction (current direction) would be 90° + 30° = 120°. Because perpendicular is 90° from downstream, and adding 30° upstream from that would be 120° from downstream. But if the current is downstream, then the direction opposite to the current is upstream. \n\nAlternatively, if the boat is moving at 30° upstream relative to the perpendicular direction, then the angle between the boat's direction and the upstream direction would be 90° -30°=60°, but this might not be the case. \n\nWait, perhaps the angle is measured from the upstream direction. Let me draw a diagram mentally. If the river flows to the right (downstream), then the boat wants to go straight up (perpendicular). The boat must aim upstream at an angle θ from the perpendicular. So the direction of the boat's velocity relative to water is θ degrees upstream from perpendicular. The angle between the boat's direction and the upstream direction would be 90° - θ. \n\nBut the question is asking, what angle should the boat start at to reach the opposite point. The options are 120°, 150°, etc. If θ is 30° upstream from the perpendicular, then the angle with respect to the upstream direction is 60°, but maybe the question wants the angle measured from the downstream direction. \n\nAlternatively, if the boat is moving at 30 degrees from the perpendicular towards upstream, then the angle relative to the downstream direction (which is the direction of the current) is 90° (perpendicular) plus 30°, totaling 120°. Because downstream is the direction the river is flowing. So if you imagine the downstream direction as 0°, then perpendicular is 90°, and upstream is 180°. So if the boat is pointing 30° upstream from perpendicular, that's 90° + 30° = 120° from downstream. So the angle with respect to the downstream direction is 120°, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, in the options, A is 120°, B is 150°, etc. So according to this calculation, the answer would be 120°. But wait, that contradicts the previous result where θ was 30°, but how is that converted into the answer's angle. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's re-examine. \n\nThe boat's velocity relative to water is 20 m/s at an angle θ upstream from the direction perpendicular to the current. So, the boat's direction is such that in order to cancel the downstream drift, it needs to have a component upstream. \n\nThe current is 10 m/s downstream. The boat's velocity relative to water has a component upstream (against the current) of 20 sinθ. To cancel the current, 20 sinθ must equal 10 m/s. So sinθ = 0.5 → θ = 30°. \n\nTherefore, the boat must head at 30° upstream relative to the perpendicular direction. \n\nNow, the question is asking for the angle with respect to the starting point's direction. Wait, the starting point's opposite is directly across. So the direction from the starting point to the opposite point is perpendicular to the current. \n\nThe boat's direction (relative to the water) is 30° upstream from the perpendicular. So the angle between the boat's direction and the perpendicular is 30°, but the question might be asking for the angle between the boat's direction and the direction of the current (downstream). \n\nIf the perpendicular is 90° from downstream, then the boat's direction is 90° - 30° = 60° upstream from downstream? Or 90° + 30° = 120° from upstream? \n\nWait, perhaps the angle is measured from the upstream direction. Let me think again. \n\nIf the current is flowing downstream (to the right, let's say), and the boat wants to go straight up (perpendicular). The boat's direction is 30° upstream from the perpendicular. So if you imagine a coordinate system where downstream is along the positive x-axis, and perpendicular is the positive y-axis, then the boat's velocity is at an angle of 180° - 30° = 150° from the positive x-axis (downstream). Because from the downstream direction (x-axis), turning 180° would be upstream, then back 30° towards the perpendicular. So the angle with respect to downstream is 150°. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Let's visualize it: if downstream is 0°, then perpendicular is 90°, and upstream is 180°. If the boat is pointing 30° upstream from the perpendicular, that would be 90° + 60°? Wait, no. If perpendicular is 90°, and the boat is 30° upstream from perpendicular, then it's pointing at 90° + 30° = 120° from downstream? Or 90° - 30° = 60° from upstream? \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe another approach: using vector components. \n\nLet’s assume the downstream direction is the positive x-axis. The boat wants the resultant velocity to be purely in the y-direction (perpendicular). \n\nThe boat's velocity relative to water (Vb) is at an angle θ upstream from the y-axis. So the components of Vb are: \n\nVb_x = -20 sinθ (since it's upstream, negative x-direction) \n\nVb_y = 20 cosθ \n\nThe river's velocity (Vr) is +10 m/s in the x-direction. \n\nResultant velocity (V) components: \n\nV_x = Vb_x + Vr = -20 sinθ + 10 \n\nV_y = Vb_y = 20 cosθ \n\nTo have the resultant velocity purely in y-direction (so the boat reaches directly opposite), V_x must be 0. \n\nSo:\n\n-20 sinθ +10 = 0 → sinθ = 10/20 = 0.5 → θ = 30°\n\nSo θ is 30 degrees upstream from the y-axis (perpendicular). \n\nNow, the question is: the angle at which the boat must start, measured from what reference? If the reference is the direction of the current (downstream, positive x-axis), then the angle between the boat's direction and the downstream direction is 90° + 30° = 120°, because the boat is 30° upstream from perpendicular. So from downstream (0°), perpendicular is 90°, and adding 30° upstream from there gives 120°. \n\nAlternatively, if θ is measured from the upstream direction, then it would be 180° - 120° = 60°, but that's not in the options. \n\nBut according to this calculation, the angle with respect to the downstream direction is 120°, which is option A. However, one of the options is 150°, which is 180° - 30°, but that might not be the case. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the angle with respect to the upstream direction. If downstream is 0°, then upstream is 180°. But the boat is pointing at 120° from downstream, which is 60° from upstream (180° - 120° = 60°). But that's not an option either. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is measuring the angle from the direction of the resultant velocity. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, the problem states: \"যাত্রা বিন্দুর ঠিক বিপরীতে পৌঁছাতে কত কোণে রওনা দিতে হবে?\" Which translates to: \"At what angle should one depart to reach exactly opposite the starting point?\" \n\nThe starting point's opposite is directly across the river. So the direction of the desired path is perpendicular to the current. The boat must aim upstream at an angle θ from the perpendicular direction. But how is this angle being measured in the options? \n\nIf the options are given with respect to the direction of the current (downstream), then the angle would be 90° (perpendicular) plus θ (30°), totaling 120°, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, another possibility: if the boat's direction is 30° upstream from the perpendicular, then the angle between the boat's direction and the upstream direction is 90° - 30° = 60°, so from upstream, it's 60°, but that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question measures the angle from the upstream direction, so the boat's direction is 180° - 30° = 150° from the downstream direction. Wait, this is getting confusing. \n\nLet me think differently. If the current is flowing to the east at 10 m/s, and the boat wants to reach a point directly north of the starting point. The boat's speed in water is 20 m/s. To counteract the eastward current, the boat must aim westward (upstream) at an angle such that the westward component of the boat's velocity cancels the eastward current. \n\nThe westward component of the boat's velocity is 20 sinθ. Setting 20 sinθ = 10 → θ = 30°. So the boat is heading 30° west of north. \n\nNow, in terms of angles from the north (desired direction), it's 30° west of north. But if the question is asking for the angle measured from the south (starting point's opposite is north), but that's not relevant. \n\nAlternatively, the angle could be measured from the upstream direction (west). If the boat is heading 30° west of north, then the angle from the west direction would be 60°, because north is 90° from west. \n\nBut none of the options match 30° or 60°. Wait, the options are A:120°, B:150°, C:90°, D:30°. \n\nWait, if the boat is heading 30° west of north, then the angle from the east direction (downstream) is 180° - 30° = 150°. Because east is 0°, north is 90°, west is 180°, and south is 270°. So if the boat is heading 30° west of north, its direction is 90° + 30° = 120° from east. Or, alternatively, from the east (downstream), the angle is 180° - 30° (west of north) = 150°? \n\nWait, I need to get this straight. Let's use the coordinate system:\n\n- East (downstream) is 0°.\n\n- North is 90°, West is 180°, South is 270°.\n\nIf the boat is heading 30° west of north, that means from north, it's turned 30° towards west. So in terms of standard angles measured from east (0°), this would be 90° (north) + 30° = 120°. So the angle with respect to east is 120°, which is option A. \n\nAlternatively, if the boat's heading is 30° upstream from the perpendicular (north), then the angle with respect to the east (downstream) is 180° - 30° = 150°? No, that doesn't fit. \n\nWait, in standard position, angles are measured from the positive x-axis (east) counterclockwise. So if the boat is heading 30° west of north, that's 90° (north) plus 30°, totaling 120°. So the direction is 120° from the east (downstream). Therefore, the angle at which the boat must depart is 120°, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, earlier calculation said theta is 30°, which is the angle upstream from the perpendicular. So this would translate to 120° from downstream. So option A is 120°, which would be correct. \n\nBut another possibility arises. If the boat's velocity relative to water is at 150° from downstream (east), then that would be 150° measured counterclockwise from east. That would be pointing northwest. Let's see: 180° is west, so 150° is 30° west of south. That doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, no. 0° is east, 90° north, 180° west, 270° south. So 150° is 60° north of west. Wait, no. From east, 90° is north, 180° is west, so 150° is 150° - 90° = 60° west of north. Wait, no. 150° is 90° (north) + 60° west. So it's 60° west of north. So if the boat is heading 60° west of north, then the westward component is 20 sin60°, which would be more than 10 m/s, which would overcompensate. That contradicts our earlier requirement of 30° upstream from north. \n\nThus, the correct angle from downstream is 120°, which is 30° west of north. So option A is 120°, which would be the correct answer. \n\nBut wait, the options given are A:120°, B:150°, C:90°, D:30°. \n\nBut wait, in the initial calculation, theta was 30° upstream from the perpendicular (north), which translates to 120° from downstream (east). So the answer is A. \n\nHowever, I've seen similar problems where the answer is 150°, which is making me doubt. Let me check once again. \n\nSuppose the boat's velocity relative to water is v = 20 m/s at angle θ from upstream direction. Then to cancel the downstream current, the component of the boat's velocity upstream must be 10 m/s. \n\nWait, if θ is measured from upstream, then the component against the current is 20 cosθ. Because if the boat is pointing θ degrees from upstream, then the upstream component is 20 cosθ, and the component across is 20 sinθ. \n\nWait, this could be where the confusion is. Depending on how the angle is measured. \n\nIf the boat is heading at an angle θ from the upstream direction (i.e., against the current), then the upstream component is 20 cosθ, and the cross-stream component is 20 sinθ. \n\nTo cancel the downstream current of 10 m/s, the upstream component must be 10 m/s. So 20 cosθ =10 → cosθ = 0.5 → θ=60°. \n\nSo the angle from upstream is 60°, which would make the angle from downstream (180° - 60°)=120°. Wait, but this is different from before. \n\nWait, this shows that the angle depends on how it's measured. If the problem is measuring the angle from upstream, then θ is 60°, but if measuring from perpendicular, it's 30°. \n\nBut the question is in Bangla: \"কত কোণে রওনা দিতে হবে?\" Which translates to \"at what angle should one depart?\" The problem doesn't specify the reference direction. But generally, in such problems, the angle is measured from the direction of the resultant velocity (perpendicular) or the direction of the current. \n\nBut in the absence of a specified reference, it's ambiguous. However, in standard physics problems, when a boat is crossing a river, the angle is often measured with respect to the upstream or downstream direction. \n\nWait, let's re-express the problem with vectors. \n\nLet’s define the downstream direction as positive x. To reach the opposite point directly, the resultant velocity must be along the y-axis (perpendicular). \n\nThe boat's velocity relative to water is Vb = 20 m/s at angle θ upstream from the y-axis (perpendicular). \n\nThe river's velocity is Vr = 10 m/s along +x. \n\nThe resultant velocity V = Vb + Vr. \n\nVx = 20 sinθ (since θ is measured from y-axis upstream, so the x-component is negative, but wait, need to clarify coordinates). \n\nWait, if the boat is heading upstream at θ from the perpendicular (y-axis), then the x-component (along the river) is -20 sinθ (since it's upstream), and the y-component is 20 cosθ. \n\nAdding the river's velocity (10 m/s downstream, +x), the resultant velocity components are:\n\nVx = -20 sinθ + 10 \n\nVy = 20 cosθ \n\nFor Vx to be zero (so the resultant is purely Vy):\n\n-20 sinθ +10 =0 → sinθ=0.5 → θ=30°. \n\nSo θ is 30° upstream from the perpendicular (y-axis). \n\nNow, the angle of the boat's direction relative to the downstream direction (x-axis) is 90° + 30° = 120°, measured counterclockwise from downstream. Hence, the answer is 120°, option A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A:120°.\n</think>",
