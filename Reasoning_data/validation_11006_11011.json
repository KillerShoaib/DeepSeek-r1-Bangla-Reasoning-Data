        "reason": "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the unit of reaction rate. Hmm, reaction rate, right? I remember from chemistry that reaction rate is about how fast a reaction happens. The rate is usually concentration change over time.\n\nSo, concentration is measured in moles per liter, which is mol/L or mol L⁻¹. And time is in seconds. So the rate would be concentration divided by time. Wait, wait. Reaction rate is the change in concentration per unit time. So the unit should be concentration (mol/L) divided by time (seconds), which would be mol/(L·s) or mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹. \n\nLooking at the options: Option B is mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹, and option D is written as mol L⁻¹s⁻¹. Wait, maybe there's a typo in the options. Let me check again. The options are A: mol L-1 m-1, B: mol L-1 s-1, C: mol mL-1 s-1, D: mol L-1s-1. Oh, I see. Option B and D are similar, but D might be missing a space. But in terms of units, both B and D would be the same. Wait, no, maybe D is written as mol L⁻¹s⁻¹ without the space, but that's the same as B. Wait, no, maybe the options have a typo. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the standard unit for reaction rate is indeed concentration per second. Concentration is mol per liter, so mol L⁻¹ divided by seconds (s⁻¹) gives mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹. So the correct unit is mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹. So between B and D, maybe the difference is a space. But in the options given, B is written as \"mol L-1 s-1\" and D is \"mol L-1s-1\". The correct notation usually has the exponents properly formatted, but in text, sometimes spaces are omitted. However, in terms of actual units, both B and D would represent the same thing. Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no. The standard unit is mol/(L·s), which is written as mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹. So the correct answer should be option B. But wait, option D is written as \"mol L-1s-1\" without a space between L-1 and s-1. Maybe that's a typo, but in terms of unit notation, it's the same. But maybe the options are presented correctly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOriginal options: \nA: mol L-1 m-1\nB: mol L-1 s-1\nC: mol mL-1 s-1\nD: mol L-1s-1\n\nAh, option D is missing a space between L⁻¹ and s⁻¹. But in terms of unit representation, it's the same as B. Wait, but maybe the correct answer is B. Because in standard notation, each unit is separated by a space. For example, \"mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹\" is correct, whereas \"mol L⁻¹s⁻¹\" might be considered incorrect formatting. But in terms of meaning, they are the same. However, in exams, sometimes such formatting matters. But in this case, maybe the options have a typo, and both B and D are same. But that's unlikely. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the reaction rate is typically expressed as concentration per unit time. Concentration is mol per liter (mol/L), and time is in seconds. So the unit is (mol/L)/s = mol/(L·s) = mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹. So the correct answer is B. But why is D an option? Maybe D is written as mol L⁻¹s⁻¹ without the space, but that's technically the same. However, in some contexts, the space is important. For example, \"ms\" could mean millisecond, but \"m s\" is meter-second. But in this case, L⁻¹s⁻¹ would be liters inverse seconds inverse. But the correct way is to write L⁻¹ s⁻¹ with a space. So the correct answer is B. But if the options have D as \"mol L⁻¹s⁻¹\" without space, maybe it's a typo, but the intended answer is B. Alternatively, maybe the options are written correctly, and D is a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo. Let me look at the options again. The user provided options as:\n\n{'A': 'mol L-1 m-1', 'B': 'mol L-1 s-1', 'C': 'mol mL-1 s-1', 'D': 'mol L-1s-1'}\n\nSo option D is written as \"mol L-1s-1\" without a space between L-1 and s-1. But in standard notation, it's written with a space. So the correct answer is B. Because D is written without the space, which might be incorrect. So the answer is B.\n</think>",

        "reason": "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the integral of dx divided by (e^x + e^(-x)). Hmm, I need to find which of the options A to D is the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I remember that integrating 1 over something like e^x plus e^(-x) might require a substitution. Let me think. The denominator is e^x + e^(-x). Maybe I can factor out e^(-x) to simplify it. Let's try that.\n\nSo, e^x + e^(-x) = e^(-x)(e^(2x) + 1). Wait, if I factor out e^(-x), then e^(-x) times e^(2x) is e^x, and e^(-x) times 1 is e^(-x). So that works. So the denominator becomes e^(-x)(e^(2x) + 1). Then the integral becomes ∫ [dx / (e^(-x)(e^(2x) + 1))] = ∫ [e^x dx / (e^(2x) + 1)]. Because dividing by e^(-x) is the same as multiplying by e^x.\n\nNow the integral is ∫ e^x / (e^(2x) + 1) dx. Let me make a substitution here. Let u = e^x. Then du/dx = e^x, so du = e^x dx. That's perfect because the numerator is e^x dx, which is du. So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ du / (u^2 + 1). \n\nThe integral of 1/(u^2 +1) du is arctan(u) + C. So substituting back, that's arctan(e^x) + C. Looking at the options, option C is tan-1(e^x), which is the same as arctan(e^x). So the correct answer should be option C.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in substitution? Let's go through again. Original integral: 1/(e^x + e^(-x)) dx. Multiply numerator and denominator by e^x to eliminate the negative exponent. That gives e^x / (e^(2x) + 1) dx. Then substitution u = e^x, du = e^x dx. So yes, integral becomes du/(u² +1), which is arctan(u) + C. So yes, arctan(e^x) is correct. So option C is the right answer.\n</think>",
        "gen_ans": "The integral ∫dx/(e^x + e^(-x)) can be solved by simplifying the denominator. Multiplying numerator and denominator by e^x transforms the integral into ∫e^x/(e^(2x) + 1) dx. Substituting u = e^x (du = e^x dx) converts it to ∫du/(u² + 1), whose solution is arctan(u) + C. Reverting to the original variable gives arctan(e^x). Therefore, the correct answer is **C. tan⁻¹(e^x)**.\n\n**Answer:** C"

        "reason": "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is asking which amendment to the Bangladesh Constitution abolished the position of the Vice President. The options are A through D, each corresponding to a different ordinal number in Bangla: একাদশ (11th), দ্বাদশ (12th), ত্রয়োদশ (13th), চতুর্দশ (14th). \n\nFirst, I need to recall the history of constitutional amendments in Bangladesh. I remember that the Vice President's post was part of the government structure at some point. The position was probably abolished when the country transitioned back to a parliamentary system from a presidential one. \n\nThe 12th Amendment is significant because it was passed in 1991, which restored the parliamentary system. Before that, under President Ershad's rule, there was a presidential system. The 12th Amendment would have restructured the government, possibly removing the Vice President role since the Prime Minister became the head of government again.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The 12th Amendment in 1991 indeed re-established the parliamentary system. In a parliamentary system, the President is a ceremonial head, and the Prime Minister holds executive power. The Vice President position was part of the presidential system setup. So when they switched back, they might have abolished the VP position through that amendment. \n\nAlternatively, the 13th Amendment introduced the caretaker government system, but that's unrelated. The 14th Amendment dealt with reserved seats for women. The 11th Amendment was about ratifying the appointment of the Chief Justice as Vice President. Wait, that's a bit confusing. \n\nWait, the 11th Amendment in 1991 allowed the Vice President to become Acting President, and later ratified the actions of Shahabuddin Ahmed as Vice President who became Acting President. But maybe the actual abolition happened later. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the Vice President position was abolished by the 12th Amendment. Because after the 12th Amendment, the parliamentary system was restored, so the President's role became ceremonial, and the Vice President's position was no longer needed. So the 12th Amendment (দ্বাদশ) would be the correct answer. \n\nBut I need to be careful. Let me check another angle. The 12th Amendment was passed in 1991. Before that, during the presidential system, there was a Vice President. After the amendment, the parliamentary system was reinstated, so the VP position was abolished. Therefore, the correct answer should be B, দ্বাদশ.\n</think>",

        "reason": "<think>Okay, let's see. I need to find the coordinates of the point where the two circles touch each other. The equations given are (x−4)² + (y−9)² = 1 and (x−2)² + (y−9)² = 1. Hmm, both circles have the same y-term, (y−9)², so their centers must be aligned along the x-axis. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's recall the standard form of a circle: (x−h)² + (y−k)² = r², where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius. So for the first circle, the center is at (4,9) and radius is √1 = 1. The second circle has center at (2,9) and radius also 1. \n\nNow, the distance between the centers of the two circles is important. The centers are (4,9) and (2,9). The distance between them is the difference in the x-coordinates since y-coordinates are the same. So distance = |4 - 2| = 2 units. \n\nEach circle has a radius of 1. If the distance between centers is equal to the sum of the radii, the circles touch externally. Here, sum of radii is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the distance. So they touch externally at exactly one point. \n\nThe point of contact should lie along the line connecting the two centers. Since the centers are on the x-axis (same y=9), the line connecting them is horizontal. The point of contact will be exactly halfway between the two centers if they were overlapping, but wait, since they are touching externally, the point should be in the direction from each center towards each other. \n\nWait, the centers are 2 units apart, each radius 1. So from the first center (4,9), moving 1 unit towards the second center (2,9) would reach (4 -1, 9) = (3,9). Similarly, from the second center (2,9), moving 1 unit towards the first center would be (2 +1,9) = (3,9). So the point where they touch is (3,9). \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 3,9. So the answer should be A. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, solving the equations:\n\nSubtract the two equations to eliminate the y terms. \n\nFirst equation: (x−4)² + (y−9)² = 1  \nSecond equation: (x−2)² + (y−9)² = 1  \nSubtracting second from first:  \n(x−4)² - (x−2)² = 0  \nExpanding both squares:  \n(x² -8x +16) - (x² -4x +4) = 0  \nSimplify:  \n-8x +16 +4x -4 = 0  \n-4x +12 = 0  \n-4x = -12  \nx = 3  \n\nThen plug x=3 into one of the equations to find y. Let's take the first equation:  \n(3−4)² + (y−9)² = 1  \n(-1)² + (y−9)² =1  \n1 + (y−9)² =1  \n(y−9)² =0  \ny−9=0  \ny=9  \n\nSo the point is (3,9), which is option A. That confirms it.

The OIC, being an important group for Muslim-majority countries, would be one of them. \n\nI recall that in 1974, there was a summit in Lahore, Pakistan.
