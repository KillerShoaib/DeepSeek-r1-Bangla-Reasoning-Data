I remember that in a pendulum's motion, energy converts between kinetic and potential. At the highest points of its swing, when it momentarily stops before swinging back, the kinetic energy should be zero, right? Because all the energy is potential there. But wait, how many highest points are there in a full oscillation? A full oscillation is from one extreme to the other and back. So, when the pendulum swings from one side to the other and comes back, that's one full oscillation.\n\nWait, the question says \"পূর্ণ দোলনের ক্ষেত্রে\" which means during a complete oscillation. So during one complete swing, the pendulum goes from the highest point on one side, through the lowest point (where it's moving fastest, so kinetic energy is max), to the highest point on the other side, and then back.

The formula I recall is θ = λ/d, where λ is the wavelength and d is the separation between the two slits. Wait, angular width here would be the angle between successive bright or dark fringes.

The options are A: -OH, B: NH3, C: H2O, D: AlCl3.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what an electrophile is. From what I recall, electrophiles are species that are electron-deficient and seek electrons. They are attracted to regions of high electron density, so they are typically positively charged or have a partial positive charge. They accept electrons during a chemical reaction. Examples include things like H+ (a proton), AlCl3, BF3, etc.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: -OH. That's the hydroxide ion. It has a negative charge, so it's rich in electrons. That would make it a nucleophile, not an electrophile. Nucleophiles donate electrons. So probably not A.\n\nB: NH3. Ammonia. It's a molecule with a lone pair on the nitrogen. It's also a nucleophile because it can donate that lone pair. For example, in reactions, NH3 acts as a nucleophile. So B is likely a nucleophile, not the answer.\n\nC: H2O. Water. Similar to NH3, it has lone pairs on oxygen. Water can act as both a weak nucleophile and electrophile depending on the situation, but generally, it's more of a nucleophile.

So, the question is about finding the coordinates of the point that divides the line segment joining (1,4) and (9,-12) internally in the ratio 5:3. Hmm, right. I remember there's a section formula in coordinate geometry for this kind of problem. Let me recall.\n\nThe formula for internal division of a line segment between two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) in the ratio m:n is [(mx₂ + nx₁)/(m + n), (my₂ + ny₁)/(m + n)]. Wait, is that correct? Yes, I think so. So here, the ratio is 5:3, so m is 5 and n is 3. The points are (1,4) and (9,-12). Let me plug these into the formula.\n\nFirst, for the x-coordinate: (5*9 + 3*1)/(5+3). Let me calculate that. 5 times 9 is 45, and 3 times 1 is 3. Adding them gives 45+3=48. Then divide by 5+3=8. So 48 divided by 8 is 6. So the x-coordinate is 6.\n\nNow the y-coordinate: (5*(-12) + 3*4)/(5+3). Let's compute numerator first. 5 times -12 is -60,",
